Hello to the person opening this README.
There are a few things to go through before you access my website.

There is a README.md file which describes how you can run my code for testing, or 
you can just use the website link which is being hosted LIVE.

I am hosting my own domain through hostGator. [EDIT: After hosting this website, the resolutions on phone looked perfect
but i noticed an error or two, for example you can zoom out too much - and the urgent contact isn't fully in the modal]
[NOTE: This is my first time hosting a website, and even though i definded all the resolutions at the bottom of my css,
this issue still occured so please excuse me for this!]

WEBSITE LINK : zafhousing.com

Upon access, you will be greeted by a Login button on the top right as well as many other features.
The way login's work with this website is, every address that ZAFHousing owns has it's own unique
login email.

A private message has been sent to every tenant regarding their unique email address
with a unique password attached. Only us (the company; as I am a family member of this family company)
have access as well as the respective tenant.

An example of this would be => address@zafhousing.com : uniquepassword

For testing purposes, I have created a login for City University so that you may use this feature on 
the website.

YOUR DETAILS => cityuniversity@zafhousing.com : cityuniversity

Upon logging in, you will now see an account button on the top right rather than a login now.
There is a pay button towards the bottom right of the screen. This is definitely accessible for you, 
but please, *** DO NOT ACTUALLY PUT YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS IN AND PAY FOR THE RENT!!! *** 

Another thing to note, I have removed the actual numbers for the urgent contact button. This is due to 
only actual tenants having access, and while this website is being tested by markers I do not want this 
displayed. After report submission and deletion of the cityuniversity login details to my website, 
everything will work as it is supposed to. Thank you for understanding.

Now, regarding authentication on logging in and storing user details / rent amount -> this is all done
on my backend through Firebase Authentication (for logins) and Firebase Firestore (for data). Stripe was
used to implement paying. These are things that I am not able to show you to protect user data that is
CONFIDENTIAL. In my report, however, I will show snippets of what the backend looks like blurring out
most of it so that I can protect user data.

Besides from this, in the discover tabs everything listed property is set as an example to show you what 
it would look like if we did have a property available, which we currently do not. An example message is
set there already. The listings in the Discover tab are not from the backend and the data for this is 
located in data.js.

ON PRESSING THE CONTACT BUTTON. TO MINIMISE MODAL PLEASE PRESS CONTACT BUTTON AGAIN (THIS APPLIES TO MAIL
BUTTON ON BOTTOM RIGHT) - THANK YOU

If you have any other questions about features during marking, please do not hesitate to email me. I respond
very quickly. rizwanmirza22@hotmail.com or rizwan.mirza@city.ac.uk.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and mark my work. Hopefully you are impressed by this project I 
put my all in to!
